    <h1>
      Basic HTML Animals
    </h1>

    <p>
      This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.
    </p>

    <h2>
      The Llama
    </h2>

    <p>
      Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a
      web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
    </p>

    <h2>
      The Anaconda
    </h2>

    <p>
      The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly
      by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
